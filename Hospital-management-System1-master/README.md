# Hospital-Management-System
My software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient and staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current status of each room. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id.

The Hospital Management System can be used by entering respective username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. Only the respective person can add data in the database.
